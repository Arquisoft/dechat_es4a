The decentralized chat app, deChat, is based on SOLID, which is a project led by Tim Berners-Lee, father of the 
World Wide Web. Its name stands for "SOcial LInked Data". The main goal of SOLID is to give the user full control over their data and 
who can access it, to achieve this, the SOLID PODs have been created. These PODs also let users decide where their data is stored, 
it can be stored in their personal PC or in an onlive server from various SOLID providers. In order to Log in to the deChat app you can use your SOLID POD.
