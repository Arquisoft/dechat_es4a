== System Scope and Context
****
The scope of our project is to create an app that can communicate two people without their data having to go through an external server, that is, this app uses data that is in our private server (POD).

For all this we are using Solid that is a tool that allows users to mark their data, which allows them to have their own server. They can also specify which data to communicate with whom and which apps can access which parts of their data do not need that your data go through an intermediary that makes money with private data

The stakeholders who can use this app will be anyone who has added as a friend in solid to the other person, so that they can access their POD with the data of this person.

In this application we will use an interface that allows you to see the name of the other person with whom you are chatting and the messages sent and received, we will have a box to write the message to send. These messages will be stored in the POD so that conversation the messages are completely isolated and only people who chat among them will be able to access them.

The communication interface is that of any chat of this style, so that stakeholders will be known and therefore more intuitive. On the other hand our interface will be made with a library of JavaScript with the aforementioned, an area to write the text to send, another to see the conversation we have with the other person and finally a small part above in which we will see the name of the other person.

=== Business Context

****
The communicated parties are the stakeholders that can be anyone who wants to have a conversation with this app. There are also the PODs of each of the users that will be used to save the data.

The interface will receive the messages of the two users and will save the conversation in the PODs of the two users. On the other hand it will show information of both users. The communication with Solid and the POD will be received in the application with the use of specific JavaScript libraries. The RDFs returned by the PODs will be used by the application to access the data of both users.

Being an app as simple as a chat, users should not have any problem with the use of this application.

=== Technical Context 

****

The implementation of the application has been made in angular and has a user interface that allows you to create a chat with another person who has been added to the POD.

After start a conversation, the messages of the app are stored in a private folder within the POD of each person, stored in order and using the necessary turtle system to store the information of each message.

When you reconnect, read the messages stored in the PODs again to restore the conversation.

In addition, profile images of the users are collected as well as the name of these to be displayed in the application.

The data processing is done through a rdflib library to deal with the storage of data in rdf and different modules are used that provides angular to work with solid.
