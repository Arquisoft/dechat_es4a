== Cross-cutting Concepts

=== Domain Model

In th following image, we present you the arquitecture of components we are using in this project.

=== Domain Concept

In our application we have three main domain concepts:

- POD: Place where all client data is store.
- Client: Stakeholder that uses the chat to send and receive messages.
- Message: Text or file sent by client with information for other client.

=== Architecture and design

We are using the architecture design in Angular. It is composed by modules and components following MVC (Model-View-Controller).

==== Modules

These are the main modules to run the app:

=== User Experience

==== User Interface

Design of the user interface for the app. The user interface is written with Angular 7. We also used Bootstrap templates and the default design from tutorial of SOLID Inrupt website with Angular.
We have pages for the login, registration, main page and chat.

.Login Page

.Registration Page

.Home Page

.Chat Page

There is a possibility to change background and colors from the chat. Just clicking in the three points in the chat page.
Besides, in the help button from navigation bar you can find this documentation plus user's guide and about us.


==== Internationalization

This app will be available in English.

=== Under-the-hood

==== Persistency

The application will be using the costumer POD as database from the SOLID server where the account is hosted. This POD will have all personal data and files and none will be able to administrate it except the owner, the costumer.

==== Exception/Error Handling

Most of the error handling in the application occurs in the methods of the solid-file-client library: the expected succesful event (reading a file, updating a file, creating it...) is used both as condition of not trowing an exception and the opening of a try statement. Along the whole code of the succesful event we may throw an error at any point, which lets us run the error code of the method
a prime example of this kind of error handling would be the addFriend() method in chat.component.ts, which handles the WEBID given to add a friend and throwns am error in different parts of the code after sucessfully reading the index.ttl of the user

=== Security and Safety

==== Security

All files and data from client will be contained in the POD so the costumer will be the only one who can get it. The chat will be decentralized so it will do it very secure.

==== Safety

This application itself doesn't do anything that poses a threat: it simply reads the pods and whrites on it's own, which leaves it not very open to vulnerabilities. 

=== Development Concepts

==== Testability

We made several tests for our project:

* Load Testing: tests with Gatling.
* User Acceptance Testing: made with Cucumber.
* Usability Testing: made with some volunteers. They have different ages and different knowledge of informatic.
* Monitory and Profiling Testing: tests with Google Chrome.
* Unit Testing: tests with Karma and Jasmine.
