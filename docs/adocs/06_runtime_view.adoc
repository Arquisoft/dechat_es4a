== Runtime View [TODO]

=== Log in

    1. The user runs the application:
        
        1.1. Subscenario 1: The user doesnt have a POD, they have to sign up to either Inrupt or Solid Community. (Solid Community recommended since the current version has some bugs with inrupt's PODs)
        
        1.2. Subscenario 2: The user does already have a POD, but they are not logged in, then they select their provider and enter the credentials.
        
        1.3. Subscenario 3: The user has a POD and is logged in, in this case the user can use the application from the get-go.

=== Send and recieve messages

* The messages sent must be encrypted in the users' PODs to ensure privacy over the data.
