== System Scope and Context
****
The scope of our project is to create an app that can communicate two people without their data having to go through an external server, that is, this app uses data that is in our private server (POD).

For all this we are using Solid that is a tool that allows users to mark their data, which allows them to have their own server. They can also specify which data to communicate with whom and which apps can access which parts of their data do not need that your data go through an intermediary that makes money with private data

The stakeholders who can use this app will be anyone who has added as a friend in solid to the other person, so that they can access their POD with the data of this person.

In this application we will use an interface that allows you to see the name of the other person with whom you are chatting and the messages sent and received, we will have a box to write the message to send. These messages will be stored in the POD so that conversation the messages are completely isolated and only people who chat among them will be able to access them.

The communication interface is that of any chat of this style, so that stakeholders will be known and therefore more intuitive. On the other hand our interface will be made with a library of JavaScript with the aforementioned, an area to write the text to send, another to see the conversation we have with the other person and finally a small part above in which we will see the name of the other person.

=== Business Context

****
The communicated parties are the stakeholders that can be anyone who wants to have a conversation with this app. There are also the PODs of each of the users that will be used to save the data.

The interface will receive the messages of the two users and will save the conversation in the PODs of the two users. On the other hand it will show information of both users. The communication with Solid and the POD will be received in the application with the use of specific JavaScript libraries. The RDFs returned by the PODs will be used by the application to access the data of both users.

Being an app as simple as a chat, users should not have any problem with the use of this application.

* Table: 

|===
| |Users |The PODs

|Name
|The both see each other's name in the application's interface
|The application calls the two PODs and you are given back the username

|Message Received 
|Receive the other's message and it seen in the part where the conversation shows our interface
|The application communicates the message that is in the other POD of the one that sent the message

|Message Sent
|Write the message in the box and press the button to send it, you can see it just like the once received
|The message is stored in the POD of the sender, and the application receives the link from the node that stores the message and communicates it to the other

=== Technical Context [OPTIONAL]

****
As we have not yet developed our application this part is still quite ambiguous so I show a very general vision of what we have in mind. The application will have to log in with your Solid user and then the application uses your data and your POD to save the conversation with another user

We have not yet decided on such specific types of technical decisions, but the hardware used would be a computer for each user and that both have a Solid account.
