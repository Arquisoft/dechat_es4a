=== Infrastructure Level 1

Motivation::

This is a basic overview of our project. It is basically using a Solid Pod Server where we have the information and our application will use this server to get the costumer data. Web Browser allow us to execute the application and to connect to the server.

Quality and/or Performance Features::

SOLID Server will allow us to use our application as decentralized and the client will be the only one who can administrate his/her own personal data.

Mapping of Building Blocks to Infrastructure::

.Deployment nodes and artifact
