Motivation

This is a basic overview of our project. It is basically using a Solid
Pod Server where we have the information and our application will use
this server to get the costumer data. Web Browser allow us to execute
the application and to connect to the server.

Quality and/or Performance Features

SOLID Server will allow us to use our application as decentralized and
the client will be the only one who can administrate his/her own
personal data.
