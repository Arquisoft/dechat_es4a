# Solid Chess

This is a decentralized Chess game, build on top of [Solid](https://solid.inrupt.com/).
No central sever is required to run or set up a game.
All personal data about the game is stored on your POD.
Requests to join a game are sent to the inbox of your opponent directly.
You have two types of games: a non-real-time and a real-time game.
With a non-real-time game all updates are sent to the inbox of your opponent,
who can interact with it when (s)he wants.
With a real-time game [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org) is used to allow for a direct communication between two instances of the Web app.

The game is available in the [browser](#browser) and [terminal](#cli).
Check the [live version](https://pheyvaer.github.io/solid-chess/) or one of the following screencasts:

WARNING: The "Clear inbox" button **removes all files with (chess) game data** in your inbox! So be careful!
