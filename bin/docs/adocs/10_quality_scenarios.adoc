=== Quality Scenarios

.Usage Scenarios:
* An user attempts to access the porfile of a friend -> the application makes a request to the server to access the porfile's contents of the friend's POD, retrieves them, and shows them to the user within 1 second (multimedia content may vary)
* An user attempts to access the porfile of a person that has explicitly set their profile to private -> the application makes a request to the server to access the porfile's contents of the person's POD, but due to the lack of permission the access is denied and the requesting user is informed within 1 second 
* An user changes his/her porfile picture -> The application request the server storing the POD to edit the contents, and upon obtaining permission he changes the picture. from now on people accessing this porfile will see the updated picture
* An user wants to start a conversation with a friend -> The application creates a folder in the host's private pod folder meant to host the messages of the host to the friend, and gives permission to the friend to read said messages. the host tries to read the equivalent folder in the friend's pod in order to read new messages
* An user wants to share an image to a friend -> the application saves the image in the pod/takes the already saved image from the pod, and sends the pod link to the friend, which can download said image
* An user wants befriend someone -> The application tries to modify the host's card .tll file in the POD in order to insert the person that wants to befriend in the know list

.Change Scenarios:
* The application is modified to be integrated with Github (or any website with social interaction for that matter) -> the Application now can retrieve information from the linked GitHub account, informing the user with each relevant action (Commits, updates in repostories, requests to participate in projectts, etc). If Application friends link their accounts to the application and they allow that information to be shared in settings, the user will be informed that they share platform.
* The application is modified to have conversations with non friends-> the Application uses the notification system to establish an ID to the conversation: this id will be used to keep track of the conversation without checking contacts, create folders on both PODs and give permission to both participants in order to read said messages. a block system would be implemented in order to immediately block further communication with undesirables 
* The application is modified to have group conversations with non friends and friends mixed in-> the Application uses the notification system to establish an ID to the conversation with both friends and non friends: this id will be used to keep track of the conversation without checking contacts, create folders on both PODs and give permission to both participants in order to read said messages. a block system would be implemented in order to immediately block further communication whithin the group from undesirables
