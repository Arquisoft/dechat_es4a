## Warning
Library is under active development and may have API breaking changes for subsequent major versions after 1.0.0.

## Getting started
### Step 1: Install `ng-select`:

#### NPM
```shell
npm install --save @ng-select/ng-select
```
#### YARN
```shell
yarn add @ng-select/ng-select
```
### Step 2: Import the NgSelectModule and angular FormsModule module:
```js
import { NgSelectModule } from '@ng-select/ng-select';
import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [AppComponent],
  imports: [NgSelectModule, FormsModule],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule {}
```

### Step 3: Include a theme: 
To allow customization and theming, `ng-select` bundle includes only generic styles that are necessary for correct layout and positioning. To get full look of the control, include one of the themes in your application. If you're using the Angular CLI, you can add this to your `styles.scss` or include it in `.angular-cli.json` (Angular v5 and below) or `angular.json` (Angular v6 onwards).

```scss
@import "~@ng-select/ng-select/themes/default.theme.css";
// ... or 
@import "~@ng-select/ng-select/themes/material.theme.css";

```


### Step 4 (Optional): Configuration 

You can also set global configuration and localization messages by injecting NgSelectConfig service,
typically in your root component, and customize the values of its properties in order to provide default values.

```js
  constructor(private config: NgSelectConfig) {
      this.config.notFoundText = 'Custom not found';
  }
```
### SystemJS
If you are using SystemJS, you should also adjust your configuration to point to the UMD bundle.

In your systemjs config file, `map` needs to tell the System loader where to look for `ng-select`:
```js
map: {
  '@ng-select/ng-select': 'node_modules/@ng-select/ng-select/bundles/ng-select.umd.js',
}
```

## Change Detection
Ng-select component implements `OnPush` change detection which means the dirty checking checks for immutable 
data types. That means if you do object mutations like:

```javascript
this.items.push({id: 1, name: 'New item'})
``` 

Component will not detect a change. Instead you need to do:

```javascript
this.items = [...this.items, {id: 1, name: 'New item'}];
```

This will cause the component to detect the change and update. Some might have concerns that
this is a pricey operation, however, it is much more performant than running `ngDoCheck` and
constantly diffing the array.

## Custom styles
If you are not happy with default styles you can easily override them with increased selector specificity or creating your own theme. This applies if you are using no `ViewEncapsulation` or adding styles to global stylesheet. E.g.

```html
<ng-select class="custom"></ng-select>
```

```css
.ng-select.custom {
    border:0px;
    min-height: 0px;
    border-radius: 0;
}
.ng-select.custom .ng-select-container  {            
    min-height: 0px;
    border-radius: 0;
}
```

If you are using `ViewEncapsulation`, your should use special `::ng-deep` selector which will prevent scoping for nested selectors.

```css
.ng-select.custom ::ng-deep .ng-select-container  {            
    min-height: 0px;
    border-radius: 0;
}
```
WARNING: Keep in mind that ng-deep is deprecated and there is no alternative to it yet. See [https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/17867](Here).

### Validation state
By default when you use reactive forms validators or template driven forms validators css class `ng-invalid` will be applied on ng-select. You can show errors state by adding custom css style

```css
ng-select.ng-invalid.ng-touched .ng-select-container {
    border-color: #dc3545;
    box-shadow: inset 0 1px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.075), 0 0 0 3px #fde6e8;
}
```
